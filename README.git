# Expert Selection

Re-use pretrained networks available online (*e.g.* from PyTorch Hub, HuggingFace) for different downstream tasks.

+ Load upstream models
+ For each downstream task
  + Select top model(s) according to a given metric, *e.g.* sum of top logits, entropy on predicted probabilities, feature norm, etc.
  + Fewshot finetuning
  + Test
